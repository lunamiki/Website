                <b>Chess Bot - CSE 332 - Data Structures and Parallelism</b>
                <p>The purpose of this project was to build a chess bot that plays chess against other bots. </p>
                <p>The bot would decide on the best move to make using various game theory algorithms such as </p>
                <p>Minimax and AlphaBeta. Some of these algorithms required multithreading to run more efficiently. </p>
                <p>To implment multithreading, we used Java's Fork-Join Framework. </p>
                <p>This was a 3 week partner project which we wrote in Java on the Intellij IDEA using tools </p>
                <p>such as Git to collaborate and share code. It was an exciting project to work on!</p>
                <br /></br>
                <b>Tetris - Personal Project</b>
                <p>This was a personal project that I worked on during the summer and throughout the school year.</p>
                <p>I built a game of Tetris in Java written in Intellij IDEA. Some things I learned from this project</p>
                <p>are Java Graphics and how to implement events in Java using Action Listeners. </p>
                <p>This was a fun project to make! </p>
