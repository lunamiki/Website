                    <pre class="text">
I am from Olympia, Washington and I am currently a student
at the University of Washington and pursueing a Bachelor degree
in Computer Science. I am a direct admit to the Paul Allen
School of Computer Science since August 2018. Ever since I was a little 
girl I've always been fascinated by the world of computer science
and the seemingly endless potential of programming. 
Coding and problem solving are my passions. Some of the programming languages 
I am familiar with include Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Outside of programming I enjoy reading, playing the piano and tennis.
If you would like to know more about me them please check my resume
